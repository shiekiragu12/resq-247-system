                                <p>  We believe that access to quality medical care should be a right for all individuals, not just a privilege for those who can afford it. With the high cost of medical care, many people are struggling to pay for the care they need. This is why we have introduced KOPA HUDUMA or HEALTHCARE SERVIVE FINANCING , a healthcare financing solution that helps make universal healthcare coverage a reality for all.
            
                                    Our goal is to ensure that everyone has access to quality medical care, regardless of their financial situation. We understand that navigating the healthcare system can be overwhelming, especially when faced with a medical bill and limited financial resources. That's why we have created a simple and straightforward process for determining eligibility for healthcare financing.</p>
